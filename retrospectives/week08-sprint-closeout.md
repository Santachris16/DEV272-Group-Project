##  Key Wins

-  Supabase is now fully integrated with read, write, update, and delete functionality.
-   The tab bar is fully styled, and the search bar feels natural in the layout.
-    Search results update instantly as users type (basic filtering in place).

##  Challenges

- Took longer than expected to debug CORS config on Supabase for local vs deployed web.
- Managing screen responsiveness for various devices still isn‚Äôt 100% polished.

2. Complete final project slide deck with working screenshots and GIFs
3. Create formal testing documentation/checklist
4. Lock in final GitHub push with README and setup instructions
