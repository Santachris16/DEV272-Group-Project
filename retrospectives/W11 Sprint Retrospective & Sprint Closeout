##  Retrospective Reflection

This sprint was all about wrapping everything up and making sure we submitted a complete and presentable final project. We worked well as a team to divide up responsibilities for documentation, presentation slides, and final GitHub organization. Presenting our app live went smoothly, and we were able to walk through the key features and decisions clearly. Overall, we were proud of what we built and how we collaborated.
