Project Overview
This project aims to develop a proof-of-concept mobile application using React Native and Expo. The goal is to demonstrate key functionality, technical feasibility, and user experience for a targeted use case.
Bitespin is a mobile app that randomly recommends a nearby restaurant when users are unsure where to eat. Users can set filters such as cuisine type, distance, and price range before spinning a virtual wheel. The app will fetch restaurant data from a remote API (e.g., Yelp, Google Places, or other API) and provide a fun, gamified user experience.

Objectives
•	Develop a mobile app with core features to solve the problem of decision fatigue in dining choices.
•	Required Features:
o	Navigation across 4 screens
o	2 forms with validation (filter input, feedback form)
o	Remote data storage (e.g., user preferences using SupaBase)
o	API data fetching (restaurant data)
•	Validate app viability through prototyping and user testing.
•	Demonstrate understanding of mobile development principles, project management, and teamwork.
